## Package update
* This is an update of the 'riverdist' package to maintain compatibility with
the new version of R.
* I have read and agree to all CRAN policies.

## Test environments
* local Windows 10 install, R 4.1.0
* winbuilder R-Devel
* Mac OS 12.1, R 4.1.1

## R CMD check results
* There is currently a WARNING and NOTE associated with a hidden subdirectory 
./.git when testing locally that I have been unable to resolve yet.  This issue
should not affect the package functionality and will be fixed in the future.
I am choosing to submit now to maintain compatibility with the new version of R.

## Downstream dependencies
* This is a fairly new package and there are not yet any downstream dependencies.
