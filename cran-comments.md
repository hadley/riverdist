## Package update
* This is a minor patch to fix a bug in one function.
* The previous version was an update of the 'riverdist' package to eliminate 
dependency on the 'sp' and 'rgdal' packages, and move to the newer 'sf' package.
* I have read and agree to all CRAN policies.

## Test environments
* local Windows 10 install, R 4.3.1
* winbuilder R-Devel
* Mac OS 13.4.1, R 4.3.1

## R CMD check results
* There are no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies
* This is a fairly new package and there are not yet any downstream dependencies.
