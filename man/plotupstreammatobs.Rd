\title{Plot Upstream Distance Between Observations of All Individuals}
\usage{
plotupstreammatobs(ID, survey, seg, vert, rivers, type = "boxplot",
  showN = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ID}{A vector of unique identifiers for each fish.}

\item{survey}{A vector of identifiers for each survey.  It is recommended to
use a numeric or date format (see \link{as.Date}) to preserve survey order.}

\item{seg}{A vector of river locations (segment component).}

\item{vert}{A vector of river locations (vertex component).}

\item{rivers}{The river network object to use.}

\item{type}{If \code{type} is set to \code{"boxplot"}, boxplots will be
produced for each cell.  If \code{type} is set to \code{"confint"}, lines
denoting an approximate 95 percent confidence interval for the mean will be
produced instead.  If \code{type} is set to \code{"dotplot"}, a jittered
dotplot will be produced for each cell, which will be the most appropriate
if sample sizes are small.  Defaults to \code{"boxplot"}.}

\item{showN}{Whether to display the sample size for each cell.  Defaults to
TRUE.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments for \link{upstream}.}
}
\description{
Produces a matrix of plots (boxplots are default), with plot \code{[i,j]} giving the
  distribution of upstream distances from observation \code{i} to observation
  \code{j}, for all individuals.  Each distance is calculated in
  \link{upstream}.
}
\note{
Building routes from the river mouth to each river network segment may
  greatly reduce computation time (see \link{buildsegroutes}).
