Description: Reads river network shape files and computes network distances.
    Also included are a variety of analysical and graphical tools designed 
    for fisheries research, such as minimum homerange, kernel density 
    estimation, and clustering analysis using empirical k-functions with 
    a bootstrap envelope.  Tools are also provided for editing the river 
    networks, meaning there is no reliance on GIS software.
